# Product Context: Marine Reserve Impact Evaluation App

## Purpose
The Marine Reserve Impact Evaluation App serves as an educational tool for students learning about marine protected areas and impact evaluation methodologies. It demonstrates the challenges in accurately measuring the impact of conservation interventions, specifically no-take marine reserves on fish biomass.

## Problems Solved

### Educational Challenges
- **Abstract Concepts Made Tangible**: The app transforms abstract statistical concepts like sampling bias and impact evaluation into an interactive, visual experience.
- **Experiential Learning**: Rather than just reading about sampling design, students can actively experiment with different monitoring strategies and immediately see the consequences.
- **Immediate Feedback**: The app provides instant feedback on how monitoring design choices affect impact measurements, reinforcing learning through direct cause-and-effect relationships.

### Scientific Understanding
- **Bias Visualization**: The app illustrates how biased placement of no-take zones (typically in areas with less fishing pressure) can affect impact measurements.
- **Sampling Strategy Importance**: Demonstrates why representative sampling across different habitat types is crucial for accurate impact assessment.
- **Counterfactual Thinking**: Helps students understand the concept of "true impact" by comparing what is observed versus what would have happened without intervention.

## How It Works

### User Journey
1. **Exploration**: Users are presented with a grid representing a marine environment with various habitats and protection statuses.
2. **Decision-Making**: Users decide where to place their limited survey resources (N monitoring sites) across the grid.
3. **Analysis**: After selecting sites, users calculate the impact based on their sampling design.
4. **Learning**: Users compare their survey-based impact estimate with the true impact, understanding the difference and why it occurred.
5. **Iteration**: Users can reset and try different sampling strategies or generate new scenarios to deepen their understanding.

### Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding how habitat distribution affects fish biomass
- Recognizing the importance of representative sampling across habitat types
- Appreciating how biased placement of protected areas affects impact measurement
- Learning to design monitoring programs that account for these biases
- Developing critical thinking about conservation impact evaluation

### Target Users
- Undergraduate and graduate students in marine science, conservation biology, and environmental management
- Instructors teaching courses on marine protected areas, conservation evaluation, or ecological monitoring
- Conservation practitioners interested in understanding monitoring design principles

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: Users should understand how to interact with the app with minimal instruction
- **Engaging**: The visual representation and immediate feedback should maintain interest
- **Educational**: The core concepts should be clearly communicated through the experience
- **Accessible**: The app should work across devices and be usable in classroom settings
- **Reusable**: Different scenarios can be generated for repeated learning experiences
