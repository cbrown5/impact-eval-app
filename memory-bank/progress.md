# Progress: Marine Reserve Impact Evaluation App

## Current Status: MVP Complete

The Marine Reserve Impact Evaluation App has reached its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage with all core functionality implemented and working as specified. The application successfully demonstrates how monitoring design affects the reliability of impact measures for no-take marine reserves.

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ 10x10 grid display with cell-based layout
- ✅ Random habitat distribution across grid cells
- ✅ Biased placement of no-take zones (towards areas with low fishing pressure)
- ✅ Fishing pressure gradient (decreasing from left to right)
- ✅ Site selection via clicking on grid cells
- ✅ Configurable number of survey sites
- ✅ Visual feedback for selected sites
- ✅ Impact calculation based on selected sites
- ✅ Display of survey-based impact, true impact, and difference
- ✅ Reset functionality to clear selections
- ✅ New scenario generation

### User Interface
- ✅ Clean, intuitive layout
- ✅ Clear visual distinction between no-take zones and fished areas
- ✅ Habitat icons display
- ✅ Selection counter showing current/maximum sites
- ✅ Results panel with formatted impact measures
- ✅ Responsive design for different screen sizes
- ✅ Interactive controls with appropriate feedback

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ Modular code organization
- ✅ Configurable parameters in central CONFIG object
- ✅ Biomass calculation using the specified formula
- ✅ Separation of concerns across JavaScript modules
- ✅ Event-driven architecture for user interactions
- ✅ Proper state management for grid and selections
- ✅ Documentation with JSDoc comments

## What's Left to Build

### Additional Features
- ⬜ Visual representation of fishing pressure gradient
- ⬜ Ability to save/load scenarios
- ⬜ Tutorial or guided walkthrough for first-time users
- ⬜ Additional visualizations (e.g., charts, heatmaps)
- ⬜ Detailed explanation of calculations for educational purposes

### Technical Improvements
- ⬜ Proper ES modules with import/export
- ⬜ Build process for optimization
- ⬜ Comprehensive error handling
- ⬜ Automated testing
- ⬜ Accessibility improvements
- ⬜ Performance optimizations for larger grid sizes

## Known Issues

### User Interface
1. **Habitat Icons**: Some habitat icons may not be clearly visible on certain screen sizes or resolutions
2. **Selection Limit**: No visual indication when maximum selection limit is reached (only alert message)
3. **Mobile Experience**: Interface is functional but not optimized for very small screens
4. **Fishing Pressure**: No visual indication of the fishing pressure gradient

### Technical Issues
1. **Site Count Input**: Changing the site count doesn't immediately update the selection counter until a new scenario is generated
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Not extensively tested across all browsers
3. **No Error Recovery**: Unexpected errors could leave the application in an inconsistent state
4. **Performance**: Large number of DOM elements could cause performance issues on older devices

## Testing Status

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ Grid generation and display
- ✅ Site selection and deselection
- ✅ Maximum selection limit enforcement
- ✅ Impact calculation
- ✅ Reset functionality
- ✅ New scenario generation
- ✅ Site count adjustment

### Testing Needed
- ⬜ Cross-browser compatibility
- ⬜ Mobile device testing
- ⬜ Performance testing with different grid sizes
- ⬜ Edge cases in calculations
- ⬜ Accessibility testing

## Deployment Status

The application is ready for deployment to GitHub Pages. It consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with no server-side dependencies.

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility across major browsers
2. **Documentation**: Create user guide or tutorial
3. **Visual Enhancements**: Add visual representation of fishing pressure gradient
4. **Feedback Collection**: Gather user feedback for future improvements
5. **Accessibility**: Improve keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Timeline

- **2025-03-07**: Initial implementation completed
- **2025-03-07**: Memory bank documentation created
- **Next**: Testing and refinement
- **Future**: Additional features and improvements based on feedback

## Success Metrics

The application successfully meets its primary educational goal of demonstrating how monitoring design affects the reliability of impact measures. Users can:

1. Select survey sites across different habitats and protection statuses
2. See how their selection affects the calculated impact
3. Compare their survey-based impact with the true impact
4. Experiment with different selection strategies
5. Generate new scenarios for repeated learning experiences

This provides a valuable hands-on learning tool for understanding sampling bias and impact evaluation in marine conservation contexts.
