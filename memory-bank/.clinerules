# Cline Rules: Marine Reserve Impact Evaluation App

## Project Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization
- JavaScript files are organized by functionality (config, utils, calculations, grid, app)
- Each file has a specific responsibility and should maintain separation of concerns
- Configuration parameters are centralized in the CONFIG object
- Grid state is managed by the GridState object

### Naming Conventions
- Constants are in UPPER_CASE
- Functions and variables use camelCase
- Object properties use camelCase
- CSS classes use kebab-case

### Code Style
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include JSDoc comments for functions
- Group related functionality together
- Prefer const over let when variables won't be reassigned
- Use arrow functions for callbacks and event handlers
- Avoid global variables outside of defined objects

### DOM Manipulation
- Create elements programmatically rather than using innerHTML
- Use event delegation where appropriate
- Update the DOM efficiently (minimize reflows)
- Provide visual feedback for user interactions

### State Management
- Grid state is centralized in the GridState object
- UI state (like selection counter) is derived from the grid state
- State updates should trigger appropriate UI updates
- Avoid redundant state that could get out of sync

### Calculation Logic
- Keep calculation functions pure when possible
- Separate calculation logic from UI logic
- Use clear, step-by-step calculations for maintainability
- Document the mathematical approach in comments
- The biomass calculation uses a multiplicative formula for the no-take zone effect
- The true impact is calculated using the mean of counterfactual impacts

### User Interface
- Provide clear visual distinction between different cell types
- Use consistent colors and styling
- Ensure interactive elements are obvious
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Keep the interface clean and focused on the task

### Configuration
- All adjustable parameters should be in the CONFIG object
- Document the purpose and effect of each configuration parameter
- Use sensible defaults that create a good learning experience
- Keep the configuration format consistent

## Project Intelligence

### Critical Implementation Paths
- Grid generation with random habitat distribution and no-take zones
- Site selection and visual feedback
- Impact calculation based on selected sites
- Results display with survey-based and true impact

### Known Challenges
- Balancing randomness with educational value in scenario generation
- Ensuring habitat icons are visible and distinguishable
- Making the impact calculation transparent and understandable
- Providing an intuitive interface while conveying complex concepts

### Evolution of Project Decisions
- Started with a basic grid implementation
- Added habitat icons and no-take zone visualization
- Implemented site selection with visual feedback
- Added impact calculation and results display
- Refined the UI and fixed issues with habitat display and site count input

### Tool Usage Patterns
- Use browser developer tools for debugging and testing
- Test in multiple browsers to ensure compatibility
- Use version control to track changes
- Document code with comments and JSDoc

## Future Development Guidelines

### Adding Features
- Maintain the educational focus of the application
- Keep the interface intuitive and uncluttered
- Document new features in the memory bank
- Update configuration parameters as needed

### Refactoring
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Keep the modular structure
- Update documentation to reflect changes
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Testing
- Test across different browsers
- Verify calculations with known examples
- Check edge cases (e.g., no selections, all cells selected)
- Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes

### Documentation
- Update memory bank files when making significant changes
- Document configuration parameters and their effects
- Provide clear comments for complex logic
- Keep the README up to date with usage instructions
