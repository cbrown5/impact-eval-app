# Active Context: Marine Reserve Impact Evaluation App

## Current Work Focus

The Marine Reserve Impact Evaluation App has been successfully implemented with all core functionality working as specified. The current focus is on:

1. **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive memory bank documentation to capture the project's context, architecture, and implementation details.
2. **Testing**: Ensuring all features work correctly across different scenarios and edge cases.
3. **Refinement**: Identifying any potential improvements or optimizations that could enhance the user experience.

## Recent Changes

### Feature Additions (2025-03-11)
- Added a fishing pressure gradient arrow along the bottom of the grid:
  - Visual indicator showing high (red) to low (white) fishing pressure
  - Helps users understand the spatial pattern of fishing pressure
- Implemented simple_mode option (enabled by default):
  - No-take sites only have habitat 1
  - Fished sites can have no habitat, habitat 1, habitat 2, or both habitats
- Added a toggle button for simple_mode:
  - Allows users to switch between simple and complex habitat modes
  - Grid automatically regenerates when mode is changed

### Formula Update (2025-03-11)
- Modified the biomass calculation formula to make the no-take zone effect (d) multiplicative:
  - Changed from: `a1*H1 + a2*H2 + b1*H1*H2 + c*F + d*N`
  - To: `(a1*H1 + a2*H2 + b1*H1*H2 + c*F) * d*N + (a1*H1 + a2*H2 + b1*H1*H2 + c*F)`
- Updated the calculateTrueImpact function to use the mean of counterfactual impacts:
  - Instead of comparing mean biomass between no-take and fished cells
  - Now it calculates the counterfactual impact for each cell and returns the mean of non-zero impacts

### Initial Implementation (2025-03-07)
- Created the basic HTML structure for the application
- Implemented CSS styling for the grid, controls, and results panel
- Developed JavaScript modules for configuration, utilities, calculations, grid management, and application logic
- Implemented the grid generation with random habitat distribution and no-take zones
- Added site selection functionality with visual feedback
- Implemented impact calculation based on selected sites
- Added reset and new scenario generation functionality
- Fixed issues with habitat icon display and site count input behavior

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### User Interface
- **Grid Cell Size**: Balanced between showing enough detail and fitting the entire grid on screen
- **Color Scheme**: Used light blue for fished areas, green for no-take zones, and yellow for selected sites to provide clear visual distinction
- **Control Placement**: Placed site count and new scenario controls at the top, with calculation and reset buttons at the bottom for logical workflow
- **Results Display**: Showed impact results in a separate panel that appears after calculation for clean UI

### Technical Implementation
- **State Management**: Used the GridState object to centralize grid-related state and operations
- **Calculation Approach**: Implemented separate functions for biomass calculation, survey impact, and true impact for clarity and maintainability
- **Random Generation**: Used biased randomization for no-take zones to simulate realistic placement (biased towards areas with low fishing pressure)
- **Event Handling**: Implemented event listeners for all user interactions with appropriate validation and feedback

### Open Questions
- **Performance Optimization**: Is the current implementation efficient enough for larger grid sizes if needed in the future?
- **Additional Features**: Would saving/loading scenarios be valuable for classroom use?
- **Visualization Enhancements**: Would additional visualizations (e.g., charts comparing impact measures) improve the educational value?

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
- [x] Complete memory bank documentation
- [x] Add fishing village image to the left side
- [x] Remove fishing gradient from the legend
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing across different browsers
- [ ] Gather user feedback on the interface and functionality
- [ ] Create a simple user guide or tutorial

### Medium-term Improvements
- [x] Add visual indicators for fishing pressure (fishing village image)
- [ ] Implement local storage for saving scenarios
- [ ] Enhance accessibility features
- [ ] Add optional visualization of biomass distribution across the grid

### Long-term Possibilities
- [ ] Create a version with adjustable grid size
- [ ] Add more complex habitat interactions
- [ ] Implement time-series simulation to show changes over time
- [ ] Develop a version that allows custom formula definition

## Current Challenges

- **Habitat Visualization**: Ensuring habitat icons are clearly visible and distinguishable
- **Balancing Complexity**: Providing educational value while keeping the interface intuitive
- **Random Generation**: Creating realistic but varied scenarios for repeated use
- **Calculation Transparency**: Making the impact calculation process understandable to users

## Recent Insights

- The visual distinction between no-take zones and fished areas is crucial for user understanding
- Immediate feedback on selections helps users understand the relationship between sampling design and results
- The ability to reset and generate new scenarios encourages experimentation and deeper learning
- The configuration-driven approach allows for easy adjustment of parameters to create different learning scenarios
